<p><strong>Title:</strong> What machines can learn from humans about compression</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inspired by Shannon&#8217;s work on estimating the entropy of a language, we experimented with a framework for image compression comprising one human describing images using text instructions to another, who is tasked with reconstructing the original image. These image reconstructions were then rated by human scorers on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and compared to reconstructions obtained by existing image compressors. We&#8217;ve conducted similar experiments for audio compression. The insights gleaned from these experiments offer a perspective on the potential for substantial improvements over current approaches to lossy compression.   </p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Tsachy Weissman has been on the faculty of the Electrical Engineering department at Stanford since 2003, where he enjoys activities such as research and teaching the science of information. He has served and still does on editorial boards for scientific journals, technical advisory boards in industry, and as founding director of the Stanford Compression Forum. His favorite gig to date was being an advisor to the HBO show “Silicon Valley” until he was terminated when it was realized his students are more creative and reliable consultants. He hates writing about himself in the third person.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Active Hypothesis Testing, Information Acquisition, and Active Learning</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This lecture considers the next generation of data science problems where the data can be collected actively during the training and inference phases. Consider a decision maker who is responsible to actively and dynamically collect data/samples so as to enhance the information about an underlying model or a partially observe phenomena of interest while accounting for the cost of communication, sensing, or data collection. The decision maker must rely on his current information state to constantly (re-)evaluate the trade-off between the precision and the cost of various actions.</p>
<p>The first part of this talk will report on ongoing research on the intersection of active hypothesis testing, information theory, and machine learning. In particular, we characterize an often overlooked inherent trade-off between reliability and information acquisition rate. Furthermore, appropriate variants of posterior matching is shown to significantly reduce the cost of data collection and/or data labeling while ensuring reliability and fidelity during the training or run-time. In the second part of the talk, depending on audience interest, I illustrate our findings and algorithms either in the context of 1) provable adaptivity gains for measurement-dependent noisy search, or 2) DetecDrone: an ML-enabled drone intelligence platform developed in my lab to provide search, mapping, and monitoring on off-the-shelf low cost drones.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Universal Features &#8211; Information Extraction and Data-Knowledge Integration</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> With the growing demand of using data analytics in a wide range of applications, a key research challenge has emerged to represent data in a generic semantic space, where we need to have a quantitative way to represent the useful information and knowledge succinctly, and at an abstract level. The key issues include how to define a universal interface for knowledge representation, how to manage and integrate the knowledge from multiple data sources, how to utilize domain knowledge, and how to cope with non-ideal situations such as the disparity in the quality of different datasets and precision losses in the processing.</p>
<p>We have numerous algorithms as possible ways to achieve such goals. Particularly, neural networks are expected to play a key role. The main difficulty is that we still do not have a complete theory about deep learning, to identify exactly what knowledge is learned by neural networks, what hidden assumptions are needed for the desirable performance. In this talk, we try to address this problem by developing a theoretical structure to measure the meaning of information by its relevance to specific inference problems, and from that we explain the behavior of neural networks as extracting “universal features”, defined as the solution to a specific optimization problem. This helps us not only to understand the learning process inside a large neural network, but also to draw connections to a number of well-known concepts in statistics and other learning algorithms. Based on this theoretic framework, our goal is to develop more flexible, robust, and interpretable data embedding algorithms. </p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Lizhong Zheng received the B.S and M.S. degrees, in 1994 and 1997 respectively, from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China, and the Ph.D. degree, in 2002, from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley.

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Private Information Retrieval Capacity</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Private information retrieval (PIR) refers to the problem of retrieving a file (a message) out of M messages from N distributed databases in such a way that no individual database can tell which message has been retrieved, hence the name, “private” information retrieval. PIR has originated in the computer science literature in late 1990s and has been revisited by the information theory community recently. Information-theoretic reformulation of the problem defines the “PIR capacity” as the largest number of bits that can be retrieved privately per download, equivalently, the smallest number of downloads needed per bit of privately retrieved information. In this talk, we will describe the problem, summarize break-through results in the history of the problem, and present some recent results. The talk will be self-contained; no prior information is needed, except for basic information theory and coding.  </p>
<p><strong>Bio: </strong>Sennur Ulukus is the Anthony Ephremides Professor in Information Sciences and Systems in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineeringat the University of Maryland at College Park, where she also holds a joint appointment with the Institute for Systems Research (ISR).

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Communication Theory for Key Agreement by Public Discussion</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Secrecy systems often require a key that is shared only by legitimate parties. The process of generating this key is called secret key agreement. We review communication theory of this topic, and present a few new results. The talk will consider the one-time pad (Shannon, 1949), wiretap channels (Wyner, 1975; Csiszár &amp; Körner, 1978), secret key agreement by public discussion (Mauer, 1993; Ahlswede &amp; Csiszár, 1993), and two-way channel models. Time permitting, we will also review recent results on advantage distillation protocols (Gohari, Günlü &amp; Kramer, 2018).</p>
